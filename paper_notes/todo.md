# TODO LIST

## Reading

rag use case notebook: https://docs.databricks.com/en/_extras/notebooks/source/machine-learning/structured-data-for-rag.html, should provide useful insight into specific use cases where structured data rag is needed

insight pilot: need to read specific implementation. https://aclanthology.org/2023.emnlp-demo.31.pdf

observatory: need to read on the benchmark's emphases points, what to care about when embedding a table?

## Prototyping
- figure out the rough components needed to be able to build a prototype
- look for common rag architecture parts
- look for tools for each part
