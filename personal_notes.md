# My Notes

## potential challenges

- tables have repeated headers (maybe, i'm not super sure), so maybe have to rely much heavier on metadata
 hierarchical structure, with multiple sublevels of table metadata structure?
 - in your experience with relational data, what are some interesting properties and characteristic stuff that may not be obvious to the general eye?
 

 ## vector db notes
 - need to figure out if any vector db as native structured data support (looks like none), and figure out the important differences, eg advantages and disvantages
